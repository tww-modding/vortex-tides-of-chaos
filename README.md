h1.Summary
Tweaks to the spawning locations of the ritual armies in the Vortex Campaign, to make them less rubbish.

Instead of spawning inside your own territory (Avelorn!), all armies will now spawn in various ocean areas.

They will follow the same movement logic as normal (i.e. probably beelining for your stuff).

h2.Details
Total War Warhammer 2 appears to use a co-ordinate system where 0,0 is basically the lower left hand corner of the main map.

I've included the map I used to created the spawn areas in this repository, and its flipped because it was easiest to use it to determine spawn co-ordinates in Paint.
